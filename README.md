## Data Analysis Course - Utah Valley University - Lauren Guerrero Silva
# Final Project

During these past 3 months I have been learning basic skills in R to further analyze scientific data.
One of our assignments consisted of creating a Final project where we would show all skills learned
to analyze real data for our own specific projects.
In this repository you may find all data used to create all models presented.
