## My Final Project 

### Data Analysis Course - Utah Valley University - Lauren Guerrero Silva
___

During these past 3 months I have been learning basic skills in R to further analize scientific data.
One of our assignments consisted of creating a Final project where we would show all skills learned
to analyze real data for our own specific projects.

I am currently working with mice to determine whether or not their Pomc mutation has any effect
on their sexual behaviour.
Proopiomelanocortin (Pomc) is a polypeptide found primarily in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus. 
The Pomc-allele synthesizes several products. The combination of resultant peptides makes Pomc a powerful influence
on overall health, particularly in relation to body size and fertility. A mutation at the nPE1 site of the Pomc 
gene results in a 70% deficiency of Pomc expression. In humans, this translates to extreme hyperphagia, early 
onset (and extreme) obesity, hypercortisolism, light skin, and red hair pigmentation.
Many of these effects are apparent on a mouse model. The goal is to create a mouse model that helps in determining
the cause for the observed infertility experienced by Pomc-deficient individuals, specifically evaluating the differences 
between wild-type (control) mice and affected POMC-deficient (mutant) mice in sexual behavior: libido, 
adherance to copulatory norms, and ultrasonic communication.
